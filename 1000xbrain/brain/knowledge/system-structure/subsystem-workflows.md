# USE WHEN understanding the workflows subsystem of the 1000xbrain system

# Subsystem: Workflows

## Overview

This knowledge file provides comprehensive documentation of the workflows subsystem within the 1000xbrain cognitive architecture, including its organization, activation mechanism, and relationships with other subsystems.

## Workflows Subsystem Purpose

The workflows subsystem serves as the implementation guidance component of the 1000xbrain cognitive architecture, providing:

1. **Domain-Specific Implementation Guidance**: Detailed guidance for specific workflow domains
2. **File Pattern Activation**: Automatically activated when matching files are referenced
3. **Cross-Subsystem Integration**: Coordinates workflow implementation across subsystems
4. **Context-Specific Behavior**: Tailored behavior for specific implementation contexts
5. **Workflow Standards**: Establishes standards for each workflow domain
6. **Implementation Patterns**: Provides reusable implementation patterns

As the implementation guidance component, this subsystem provides specialized guidance for specific workflow domains, activated automatically when relevant files are referenced.

## Rule Type: Auto-Attached

Files in the workflows subsystem are designated as **Auto-Attached** rule type, meaning:

- **Pattern-Based Activation**: Activated when matching files are referenced
- **Context-Sensitive Guidance**: Provides guidance relevant to the current context
- **Automatic Application**: No explicit reference required
- **File-Triggered Loading**: Loaded based on file patterns in the conversation
- **Workflow-Specific Behavior**: Behavior tailored to specific workflow domains

This rule type ensures that implementation guidance is automatically provided when relevant to the current context.

## Workflows Directory Structure

The workflows subsystem is organized by workflow domain:

```
1000xbrain/workflows/
├── rules/               # Implementation guidance for rules-workflow
│   ├── core/            # Core rules workflow guidance
│   ├── knowledge/       # Knowledge enhancement guidance
│   ├── parameters/      # Parameter development guidance
│   └── workflows/       # Workflow development guidance
├── quality/             # Implementation guidance for quality-workflow
├── front-end/           # Implementation guidance for front-end-workflow
├── back-end/            # Implementation guidance for back-end-workflow
└── scripts/             # Implementation guidance for scripts-workflow
```

This organization provides clear, domain-specific implementation guidance for each workflow type.

## Access Method: File Pattern Matching

The workflows subsystem is accessed through automatic file pattern matching:

1. When files matching specific patterns are referenced in the conversation
2. When working within a specific workflow domain
3. When implementing changes related to a specific workflow

Unlike knowledge files (which require fetch_rules) or parameters (which require @ reference), workflow files are automatically attached based on context.

## Core Workflow Types

The workflows subsystem supports five core workflow types:

1. **rules-workflow**: Enhancement of the 1000xbrain cognitive architecture
   - Focus: Enhancing the AI's cognitive capabilities
   - Key Activities: System structure improvements, knowledge organization, parameter development
   - Primary Directories: Across all subsystems, focusing on cognitive enhancement

2. **quality-workflow**: Quality assurance and monitoring
   - Focus: Ensuring system quality and reliability
   - Key Activities: Testing, verification, quality assurance, error analysis
   - Primary Directories: Quality-specific directories across subsystems

3. **front-end-workflow**: Front-end development
   - Focus: User interface and experience development
   - Key Activities: UI component development, interaction design, front-end architecture
   - Primary Directories: Front-end specific directories across subsystems

4. **back-end-workflow**: Back-end development
   - Focus: Server-side and API development
   - Key Activities: API design, data processing, service architecture
   - Primary Directories: Back-end specific directories across subsystems

5. **scripts-workflow**: Scripts and automation development
   - Focus: Development tools and automation
   - Key Activities: Script development, build tools, automation processes
   - Primary Directories: Script-specific directories across subsystems

Each workflow type has specific implementation guidance across all four subsystems.

## Workflow File Structure

Each workflow file follows a standardized structure:

1. **Title**: Clear identification of the workflow's purpose
2. **Overview**: Brief explanation of the workflow's scope and importance
3. **Implementation Standards**: Standards specific to this workflow
4. **Best Practices**: Best practices for effective implementation
5. **Examples**: Practical examples demonstrating implementation
6. **Cross-Subsystem Guidance**: How this workflow is implemented across subsystems

This structure ensures clarity and consistency in workflow implementation.

## Auto-Attached Rule Behavior

As Auto-Attached rule type, workflows subsystem files:

1. **Activate Automatically**: Loaded when matching files are referenced
2. **Provide Contextual Guidance**: Guidance tailored to the current context
3. **Apply During Implementation**: Primarily active during implementation phases
4. **Guide Tool Usage**: Provide guidance on effective tool usage
5. **Ensure Workflow Standards**: Enforce standards for each workflow domain

This automatic activation ensures appropriate guidance without requiring explicit references.

## Workflow Activation Patterns

Each workflow type is activated by specific file patterns:

1. **rules-workflow**: Activated when working with files in:
   - 1000xbrain/core/
   - 1000xbrain/knowledge/
   - 1000xbrain/parameters/
   - 1000xbrain/workflows/

2. **quality-workflow**: Activated when working with:
   - Test files
   - Verification processes
   - Quality assurance processes
   - Error analysis

3. **front-end-workflow**: Activated when working with:
   - UI components
   - Front-end architecture
   - User experience flows
   - Client-side implementations

4. **back-end-workflow**: Activated when working with:
   - API implementations
   - Server-side processing
   - Database interactions
   - Service architecture

5. **scripts-workflow**: Activated when working with:
   - Build scripts
   - Automation tools
   - Development utilities
   - CI/CD processes

These activation patterns ensure that appropriate guidance is provided based on the current implementation context.

## Common Questions and Answers

### Q: How do workflows differ from parameters?
A: Workflows provide domain-specific implementation guidance automatically activated by context, while parameters provide task-specific execution frameworks explicitly referenced in message-commands.

A: Workflows are activated automatically when files matching specific patterns are referenced in the conversation, without requiring explicit references.

### Q: How do workflows span across subsystems?
A: Each workflow has specific implementation aspects in all four subsystems, coordinated to provide consistent, domain-specific guidance.

### Q: Can I implement a new workflow type?
A: New workflow types can be implemented by adding appropriate directories and files across all four subsystems, with consistent activation patterns.
