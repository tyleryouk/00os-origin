# mode: plan-mode | workflow: rules-workflow | pathway: system-wide-optimization | filepath: @parameters/rules/plan-mode/system-wide-optimization.mdc  | optional-standard-parameter(s): none

## Purpose

This parameter provides a specialized planning structure optimized for comprehensive optimization of the 1000xbrain cognitive architecture across multiple planning folders. This approach is ideal when:

- Deep optimization of core brain-files is needed
- Knowledge organization requires pathway-based restructuring
- Cross-system terminology standardization is needed
- Message-command format updates are required
- Line count reduction targets are established

## Domain Access

- **Read Access**: All of 1000xbrain
- **Edit Access**: Limited to the /planning directory
- **Rationale**: Plan-mode focuses on documentation creation in the planning directory

## Knowledge Access

For comprehensive understanding of the system architecture and optimization approaches, access these knowledge components:

```typescript
// Access system architecture documentation
fetch_rules(["knowledge/system-structure/system-architecture"], 
           "Understanding the overall system architecture for optimization")

// Access related knowledge
fetch_rules([
  "knowledge/system-structure/workflow-subsystem-relationships",
  "knowledge/system-structure/system-vs-subsystem",
  "knowledge/system-structure/pathway-organization"
], "Understanding the relationships between components for optimization planning")

// Access optimization knowledge
fetch_rules(["knowledge/rules/system-wide-optimization/cognitive-load-optimization"], 
           "Understanding cognitive load optimization strategies")
fetch_rules(["knowledge/rules/performance/implementation-performance"], 
           "Understanding implementation performance optimization")
```

## Implementation Approach

The system-wide-optimization pathway in plan-mode focuses on planning comprehensive optimization across the cognitive architecture through these activities:

1. **Comprehensive System Analysis**: Thoroughly analyze the system architecture and optimization opportunities
2. **Optimization Target Identification**: Identify specific optimization targets with measurable metrics
3. **Cross-System Standardization Planning**: Plan standardization of patterns and terminology
4. **Implementation Sequencing**: Plan the sequence of optimization implementation across multiple folders
5. **Verification Framework Design**: Design strategies to verify optimization success

## 1000x Development Principles Alignment

The system-wide-optimization pathway upholds these core 1000x development principles:

1. **Autonomous Implementation**: Creates clear plans that enable fully autonomous implementation
2. **Minimal Guidance**: Provides comprehensive documentation to minimize required guidance
3. **Clear Role Separation**: Maintains strict separation between planning and implementation
4. **Context Preservation**: Ensures consistent context within and across planning folders
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Establishes measurable metrics for verifiable optimization
6. **Implementation Self-Diagnosis**: Creates detailed verification frameworks for self-validation
7. **Cross-Folder Coordination**: Ensures each planning folder builds upon previous optimizations

## Planning Workflow

### 1. Initial Analysis Phase

```typescript
// Access system architecture documentation
fetch_rules(["knowledge/system-structure/system-architecture"], 
           "Understanding the system architecture for optimization planning")

// Explore cognitive architecture structure (READ ONLY)
list_dir("1000xbrain")
list_dir("1000xbrain/core")
list_dir("1000xbrain/workflows")
list_dir("1000xbrain/knowledge")

// Read key architecture documentation
read_file("1000xbrain/knowledge/system-structure/system-architecture.md", should_read_entire_file=true)
read_file("1000xbrain/knowledge/system-structure/workflow-subsystem-relationships.md", should_read_entire_file=true)

// Gather quantitative metrics for optimization targets
run_terminal_cmd("(Get-ChildItem -Path \"1000xbrain/[relevant_subsystem]\" -Recurse -Filter \"*.md\" | Where-Object { $_.Name -ne \"README.md\" } | ForEach-Object { Get-Content $_.FullName | Measure-Object -Line } | Measure-Object -Property Lines -Sum).Sum", false)
```

### 2. Documentation Planning Phase

```typescript
// Create README.md overview
edit_file("planning/[project-folder]/README.md",
          "Create README.md with system-wide-optimization overview",
          "# rules-workflow | system-wide-optimization\n\n## Overview\n\nThis planning folder contains documentation for system-wide optimization...")

// Create requirements document
edit_file("planning/[project-folder]/requirements.md",
          "Document system-wide optimization requirements",
          "# Requirements: System-Wide Optimization\n\n...")

// Create implementation plans
edit_file("planning/[project-folder]/implementation-[specific-focus].md",
          "Create implementation plan for [specific-focus] optimization",
          "# Implementation Plan: [Specific Focus] Optimization\n\n...")
```

### 3. Optimization Metrics Definition Phase

```typescript
// Create test cheatsheet with verification methods
edit_file("planning/[project-folder]/test-cheatsheet.md",
          "Create test cheatsheet with verification methods",
          "# Test Cheatsheet: System-Wide Optimization\n\n## Verification Methods\n\n...")

// Create implementation progress tracking template
edit_file("planning/[project-folder]/implementation-progress.md",
          "Create implementation progress tracking template",
          "# Implementation Progress: System-Wide Optimization\n\n## Planning Status\n- Planning Phase: In Progress\n- Last Update: [timestamp]\n- Current Planning Task: [task]\n\n## Implementation Status\n[Implementation will be tracked by dev-mode - left empty in plan-mode]\n\n## Optimization Metrics\n[Relevant metrics for the specific focus]\n\n...")
```

## Planning Folder Structure

The system-wide-optimization pathway creates specialized planning structures across multiple folders:

### Required Files for Each Planning Folder

| File | Purpose | Special Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Provide planning overview | System-wide optimization approach for current phase |
| `implementation-progress.md` | Provides tracking for planning AND implementation | Separate sections for planning and implementation |
| `requirements.md` | Define optimization objectives | Identify specific optimization targets |
| `implementation-[specific-focus].md` | Plan implementation approach | Focus on specific optimization area |
| `test-cheatsheet.md` | Define testing approach | Optimization-specific validation |

**Mandatory**
README.md must have this header at the top of the file:
```
# rules-workflow | system-wide-optimization
```

## Implementation Progress Structure

The implementation-progress.md file MUST include clearly separated sections for planning and implementation, with metrics relevant to the specific optimization focus of the current planning folder.

```markdown
# Implementation Progress: [Specific Focus] Optimization 

## Planning Status
- Planning Phase: [Completed | In Progress]
- Last Update: [timestamp]
- Current Planning Task: [specific task currently in progress]
- Planning Completion: [percentage or status indicator]

## Planning Tasks
- [ ] Create README.md
- [ ] Create requirements.md
- [ ] Create implementation-[specific-focus].md
- [ ] Create test-cheatsheet.md
- [ ] Finalize all planning documents
- [ ] Signal planning-document-complete

## Implementation Status
- Implementation Phase: [Not Started | Will be managed by dev-mode]
- Implementation Tasks: [Will be managed by dev-mode]

## Optimization Metrics
- [Metric 1 relevant to focus]: [value/target]
- [Metric 2 relevant to focus]: [value/target]

## Phase Overview
- Planning: [status]
- Analysis: [Will be managed by dev-mode]
- Implementation: [Will be managed by dev-mode]
- Verification: [Will be managed by dev-mode]
```

## Cross-Folder Awareness

When planning any system-wide optimization phase, maintain awareness of:

1. **Prior Optimizations**: Reference completed optimizations from previous folders
2. **Dependency Chain**: Ensure each phase builds logically on previous phases
3. **Consistent Targets**: Maintain consistent optimization targets across folders
4. **Implementation Sequence**: Preserve the overall implementation sequence
5. **Success Metrics**: Ensure metrics align across all optimization phases

## Common Optimization Patterns

### Core Subsystem Optimization
- **Analysis Focus**: Identify redundancies and consolidation opportunities
- **Implementation Approach**: Consolidate related information and remove duplication
- **Testing Strategy**: Verify functionality maintains while reducing line count

### Knowledge Organization Optimization
- **Analysis Focus**: Map pathway-based organization structure
- **Implementation Approach**: Reorganize by pathway and standardize access patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: Verify knowledge accessibility through various pathways

### Parameter Standardization
- **Analysis Focus**: Identify parameter format inconsistencies
- **Implementation Approach**: Create consistent parameter format with standardized sections
- **Testing Strategy**: Verify parameter effectiveness across pathways

## Verification Framework

The system-wide-optimization approach includes specialized testing for optimization verification:

### Quantitative Metrics Verification
Tests for line count reduction, performance improvement, and other measurable metrics.

### Functional Equivalence Testing
Tests to ensure optimized components maintain the same functionality as original components.

## Tool Call Process

### Documentation-First Process

Always follow this documentation-first process:

1. **Knowledge Access**: Fetch knowledge about the system architecture and optimization approaches
2. **System Analysis**: Analyze system architecture and optimization opportunities
3. **Documentation Creation**: Create comprehensive planning documentation with clear metrics
4. **Implementation Strategy**: Document implementation strategy across multiple planning folders
5. **Verification Design**: Design approach for verifying optimization success

### Planning Completion

When planning is complete, send the planning-document-complete signal:

```
📋 1000xdev [rules-workflow]

planning-document-complete

Planning is complete with:
- Requirements document with clear optimization objectives and measurable targets
- Implementation plan with detailed optimization approach
- Test cheatsheet with comprehensive verification methods
- Implementation progress template with defined metrics
```

## Transition to Implementation

Once planning is complete, transition to dev-mode for implementation:

```
dev-mode rules-workflow system-wide-optimization @parameters/rules/dev-mode/system-wide-optimization.mdc none
```

This will activate the dev-mode parameter for implementing the planned system-wide optimization.

## Success Criteria

Successful system-wide-optimization planning meets these criteria:

1. **Detailed Optimization Plan**: Specific optimization targets with measurable metrics
2. **Clear Implementation Sequence**: Well-structured implementation plan with specific steps
3. **Measurable Success Metrics**: Defined metrics to verify optimization success
4. **Cross-Folder Coordination**: Alignment with previous and subsequent planning folders
5. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive verification approach for optimization
6. **Clear Domain Separation**: Planning documents explicitly separate planning from implementation
7. **Phase-Specific Guidance**: Tailored planning for each optimization phase
8. **Cohesive Optimization Strategy**: Ensures each phase builds on previous phases
9. **Quantifiable Targets**: Provides clear numerical targets for each phase
